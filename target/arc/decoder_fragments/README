This directory contains files copied from binutils project and a script that
convert the decoding tables in more usable macro definitions. Those macro files
are produced only during building, and define the following:

  <build>/target/arc/opcodes.def -> instrution decoding definitions.
  <build>/target/arc/v2_hs_dtree.def -> decision tree macros for ARCv2 HS processors.
  <build>/target/arc/v2_em_dtree.def -> decision tree macros for ARCv2 EM processors.
  <build>/target/arc/v3_hs5x_dtree.def -> decision tree macros for ARCv3 HS5x processors.
  <build>/target/arc/v3_hs6x_dtree.def -> decision tree macros for ARCv3 HS6x processors.
