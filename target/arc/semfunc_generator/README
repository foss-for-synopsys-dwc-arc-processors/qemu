Helper file for ARC instruction traslation functions.

The code generator was implemented using ruby language.
In order to change the content of semfunc.c file these scripts should be used.

Ruby instalation process:

The recommended way to obtain a compatible ruby is to install it in a user
local directory using RVM.
Instructions to install RVM can be found in https://rvm.io/.

Using RVM one can install Ruby interpreter executing the following
steps/commands.

Install Ruby version 2.6:
  # rvm install ruby-2.6
Set ruby version 2.6 as current in use.
  # rvm use 2.6
Create an isolated environment for the required ruby dependencies.
  # rvm gemset create arc_generator
Install bundler tool
  # gem install bundler
Bundle tool reads the Gemfile file and installs project dependencies.
  # cd ${QEMU_SOURCE}/target/arc/semfunc_generator & bundle install


In order to regenerate the semfunc.c file, please execute the following command.
  # ruby regenerate_semfunc.rb > ../semfunc.c

By default the tool reads the semfunc.c file and prints the new content for
the same file.
The information of what is generated is presented as comment in the file.
In order to change the functionality of those functions one should change the
"pseudo code" in the comments, which is what is used to generate the
semantically similar TCG code.
